In order to extend the tool and add more modules you'll need to do the following:

1. Add a new Enum in SupportedSitesEnum.java.
2. Extend the interface Site with your new site.
3. Create an entry for it in the SiteFactory.java.
4. Add command line options for the new site in ProcessCommandLineArguments.java.
4. Instantiate your site in the main Flights.java class.


Have fun!
